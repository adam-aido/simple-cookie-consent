## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled in the browser

## Installation

1. Download the plugin and upload it to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress Plugins menu
3. Go to Settings > Cookie Consent to configure the plugin

## Database Storage & Compliance

This plugin records all consent choices in a dedicated database table (`wp_cookie_consents`) which includes:

- User ID (for logged-in users)
- IP address (can be anonymized)
- User agent
- Consent type and details
- Timestamp of consent

### Consent Log Dashboard

Administrators can access a consent log at Settings > Consent Log to:

1. View all consent records with filterable columns
2. See which specific categories were accepted/rejected
3. Export consent records to CSV for compliance documentation
4. Track consent changes over time

### IP Anonymization

For GDPR compliance, the plugin can anonymize IP addresses before storing them:

- IPv4 addresses have the last octet replaced with zeros (e.g., 192.168.1.1 â†’ 192.168.1.0)
- IPv6 addresses have the last 80 bits (last 5 hextets) replaced with zeros

This option is enabled by default and can be configured in settings.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. After activating the plugin, go to Settings > Cookie Consent
2. Configure the general settings, including cookie expiry time
3. Customize the appearance (position and theme)
4. Edit the text for the consent banner and buttons
5. Enable/disable Google Consent Mode and set the region

### Google Consent Mode v2 Setup

1. Go to the Google Consent Mode tab in settings
2. Enable Google Consent Mode integration
3. Set your region (e.g., "EU" for European Union)
4. Optionally add your Google Tag ID

### Using Shortcodes

The plugin provides two shortcodes that can be used anywhere on your site:

#### Display a Consent Form

```html
[cookie_consent theme="light" title="Cookie Settings" button_text="Update Preferences"]
```

Parameters:

- `theme`: light or dark (default: matches your settings)
- `title`: The heading for the form (default: "Cookie Settings")
- `button_text`: Text for the save button (default: "Update Preferences")

#### Display a Settings Button

```html
[cookie_settings text="Cookie Settings" class="my-custom-class"]
```

Parameters:

- `text`: The button text (default: "Cookie Settings")
- `class`: CSS class for styling (default: "scc-settings-button")

## Security Features

This plugin includes robust security measures:

- Input validation and sanitization for all settings
- Protection against XSS and CSRF attacks
- Secure cookie storage with SameSite and Secure flags
- AJAX security with proper nonce verification
- Comprehensive error handling

## Customization

### CSS Customization

You can add custom CSS to your theme to override the default styles of the cookie consent banner and modal.

### Filter Hooks

The plugin provides several filters for developers to extend functionality:

```php
// Modify consent types
add_filter('simple_cookie_consent_types', function($types) {
    // Add or modify consent types
    $types['my_custom_type'] = [
        'id' => 'my_custom_type',
        'label' => 'My Custom Type',
        'description' => 'Description for my custom consent type',
        'required' => false,
        'gcm_purpose' => 'personalization_storage'
    ];
    return $types;
});
```
